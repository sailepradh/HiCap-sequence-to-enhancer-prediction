# HiCap-sequence-to-enhancer-prediction

Chromatin Conformation Captrue (3C) technology and subsequent enrichment of prmoters give us the genomic regions which are in close proximity in three dimensional space. However these regions could bestructural regions in genomes. In this project, I am reading the papers regarding the enhnacer predictiona nd then implementing it in HiCap data
